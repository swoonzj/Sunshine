## Weather App (Learning Android Development via Udacity)

This project is based on the course "Developing Android Apps" at https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud853/
This is currently a work in progress, and as such is nowhere near a finished product.

#### Goal:
  * An application which delivers weather forecast data based on a user-selected location.
  * Allow user to change settings such as units of measurement, number of days to forecast, etc.

#### Notes (11/10/16):
  * In order to fetch live weather data, the initial page (full of fabricated placeholder data) must be refreshed via the Menu.
  * Listview items can be clicked for (eventually) a more detailed view of the weather. (currently no extra detail) 
  * Currently, the weather data is for a hard coded location (which will be changed in an upcoming lesson).
  * Various options (number of days in forecast, units of measurement, etc) are also currently hardcoded but will become settings when I get to that lesson.
